                Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.It is the most common type of cancer in Kenyan women.Breast cancer can also affect men but that is on very rare occassion.Promotion of breast awareness and education of women on breast health are important
              aspects in early detection of breast cancer. Mammography is the recommended mode
              of screening; breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in selected highrisk populations. Breast Self-Examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and
              ultrasound are not screening modalities but are complementary to mammography and
              aid in early diagnosis of breast cancer. Age of starting screening as well as frequency will
              depend on risk assessment and stratification.</p>

                  <p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for approximately 5% of all cancers globally, making it the
                      single most common cause of cancer that is attributable to a virus. HPV is one of the commonest
                      sexually transmitted infections. Infection with one or more of the 15 high-risk oncogenic types usually
                  results in invasive cervical cancer after 10-20 years. HPV is the primary cause of 99.7% of all cervical
                      cancers. Globally, about 70% of all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV types 16 and 18. With
                      vaccines against these two types of HPV, being now available, there exists great potential to reduce the
                      incidence of cervical and other anogenital cancers</p>

                        <p>Prostate cancer is the fourth leading cancer in incidence globally, with higher mortality
                            reported in less developed regions than in more developed regions. Prostate cancer is
                            a disease of the aging male, the majority presenting after 65 years (average of 68 years).
                            This is the most common cancer among elderly male population all over the world, with
                            a slight preponderance in blacks. Incidentally autopsy prevalence rates of prostate cancer are the same across all races suggesting environmental factors play a crucial role in
                            aetiology. This compares well with.
                          In Kenya, postrate cancer is the most common type in men aged between (65-75 years)</p>

                      <article>
                        <p>Colorectal cancer is  cancer of the colon or rectum.It is among the top 10 cancers in Kenya. This type of cancer can either start at the colon or the rectum, otherwise called the large intestine.
                          .According to recent Globocan data, there were 1,354 estimated new cases and 937 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2018 in Kenya. There are probably more cases and deaths that were not reported or diagnosed.
                            Healthy cells in the lining of the colon or rectum can change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumour which can be cancerous/malignant or benign. A cancerous/malignant tumour is a tumour that can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumour means the tumour can grow but will not spread.

 Nuru cancer center has formed a National Cancer Control
      Strategy (NCCS) as a response to provide a
      strategic framework on how to prioritize interventions that will lead to prevention and control
      of cancer in Kenya. The document covers the year 2017-2022. and is organized into five  priority areas: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>prevention, early detection and screening,</li>
        <li>diagnosis, registration and surveillance,</li>
        <li>  treatment, palliative care and survivorship,</li>
        <li>coordination, partnership and managing</li>
        <li>monitoring, evaluation and research. </li>
